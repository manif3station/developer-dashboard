=head1 NAME

Developer::Dashboard::Crypto::PBKDF2 - native PBKDF2 adapter

=head1 PURPOSE

This module calls OpenSSL's one-shot PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256 implementation through
the distribution's shared XS extension. It is a narrow adapter for dashboard
helper authentication; it does not translate or accelerate arbitrary Perl
subroutines.

=head1 WHY IT EXISTS

The prior derivation called the XS HMAC function once per PBKDF2 round from a
Perl loop. A single native PBKDF2 call avoids that repeated Perl/native
boundary while retaining the existing digest, output size, and iteration
count. The portable Perl implementation remains the path when no compatible
system C<libcrypto> is available, the XS extension is not built, or input byte
semantics cannot safely cross the native boundary. Failures in an available
native PBKDF2 call remain visible.

=head1 WHEN TO USE

Use this module only for SHA-256 PBKDF2 derivation with scalar password/salt
values representable as Perl byte strings and a positive integer work factor.
Do not use it to reduce the iteration count or to parallelize one PBKDF2
chain; the chain is intentionally sequential.

=head1 HOW TO USE

Call C<native_available> to inspect whether the XS adapter and a compatible
OpenSSL library are available. Call C<derive_sha256> with named C<password>, C<salt>, and
C<iterations> arguments. An undefined result means the caller should execute
its explicit Perl implementation. Library-binding and native-call failures
die with a visible error rather than being hidden as fallback.

=head1 WHAT USES IT

C<Developer::Dashboard::Auth> calls this adapter when creating and verifying
PBKDF2 helper-user records. The Auth module retains the existing Digest::SHA
implementation for unsupported input and systems without libcrypto.

=head1 EXAMPLES

Example 1:

  my $digest = Developer::Dashboard::Crypto::PBKDF2->derive_sha256(
    password => $password,
    salt => $salt,
    iterations => 210_000,
  );

Derive the same stored PBKDF2-SHA256 key through OpenSSL when the adapter can
preserve the input byte semantics.

Example 2:

  if (Developer::Dashboard::Crypto::PBKDF2->native_available) {
      print "OpenSSL PBKDF2 acceleration is available\n";
  }

Check whether the current machine has a compatible native crypto library.

Example 3:

  d2 docker compose exec dev prove -Iblib/arch -Iblib/lib -Ilib -lv t/651-crypto-pbkdf2-xs.t

Run digest-parity, unsupported-Unicode, invalid-input, and missing-library tests.

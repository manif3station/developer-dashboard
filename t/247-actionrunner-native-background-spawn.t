=head1 NAME

t/247-actionrunner-native-background-spawn.t - specify native background process launch

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This Docker test specifies how Developer::Dashboard::ActionRunner launches a
trusted background command through Developer::Dashboard::GoRoutine's native
process API. It keeps the public result contract while ensuring the supervisor
is launched by an argv-based native process operation rather than a Perl fork.

=head1 PURPOSE

The background action implementation previously used a two-fork daemonization
path. This test records the replacement boundary: a process-group supervisor
must receive the already validated cwd, environment, log destinations, and
closed stdin behavior, then its process identifier is returned to the caller.

=head1 WHY IT EXISTS

GoRoutine's native process API supports Windows as well as POSIX systems, while
Perl fork is not portable to the requested Windows workflow. Verifying the
ActionRunner call contract prevents a future refactor from silently returning
to fork or dropping the background action's execution context.

=head1 WHEN TO USE

Run this test when changing ActionRunner background execution, GoRoutine
process spawning, process-group setup, or action environment propagation.

=head1 HOW TO USE

  d2 docker compose exec dev prove -lv t/247-actionrunner-native-background-spawn.t

The test creates a temporary dashboard home, substitutes the native spawn XSUB
to capture its exact arguments, and checks the process id and launch options.
No background process is launched by the test double.

=head1 WHAT USES IT

The distribution test harness runs this contract alongside the ActionRunner
and GoRoutine process suites. ActionRunner is the consumer of the public
background-action behavior specified here.

=head1 EXAMPLES

  my $result = $runner->run_command_action(
      command => 'echo hello', cwd => $workspace,
      background => 1, timeout_ms => 5000,
  );
  print $result->{pid};

The native process API receives the resolved command/supervisor argument list
and explicit working directory, environment, and output log paths.

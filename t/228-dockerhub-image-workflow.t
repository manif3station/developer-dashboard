=head1 NAME

t/228-dockerhub-image-workflow.t - enforce the Docker Hub image build and publish contract

=head1 PURPOSE

This repository-only test locks down the Docker Hub publication path for the
latest checked-out master source. It checks that the GitHub workflow uses the configured Docker Hub
credentials, publishes version and latest tags for Linux amd64 and arm64, and
that the Dockerfile runs the repository installer, creates a Dist::Zilla
archive, and installs that archive into the resulting CLI image.

=head1 WHY IT EXISTS

The CPAN release artifact can lag behind the code on master. A workflow that
simply installs the MetaCPAN package would therefore publish an image with old
code while labeling it current. These assertions keep the image build anchored
to the checkout and its freshly generated tarball.

=head1 WHEN TO USE

Run this test whenever changing Docker Hub publication, the multi-platform
Dockerfile, the version/tag contract, or the workflow's credential wiring.

=head1 HOW TO USE

    prove -lv t/228-dockerhub-image-workflow.t
    d2 docker compose exec dev prove -lv t/228-dockerhub-image-workflow.t

=head1 WHAT USES IT

The normal repository test suite runs this test before the Docker Hub workflow
is considered ready to publish a versioned image and the latest tag. Dist::Zilla
excludes GitHub automation files from released archives, so the test skips when
it runs from an installed source archive.

=head1 EXAMPLES

=over 4

=item *

Confirm a master push builds the source tarball rather than selecting only the
published CPAN release.

=item *

Confirm the resulting image manifest has Linux amd64 and arm64 variants and
provides a versioned rollback tag plus C<latest>.

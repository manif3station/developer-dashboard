# The two assertions that used to sit here - that running_loops reports the
# adopted supervisor, and that stop ends it - were moved to DD-543. They were

=head1 NAME

t/153-collector-loop-accumulation.t - a singleton collector must stay singular

=head1 PURPOSE

Verify that starting a collector whose pidfile has been lost does not add a
second supervisor loop, that status still reports the one that is running, and
that stop ends every supervisor rather than only the pid it had recorded.

=head1 WHY IT EXISTS

Twenty-seven supervisor loops were alive at once for a collector declared
C<mode: singleton>, from starts spanning 04:33 to 07:21 on one morning. Each
fired every 900 seconds and each spawned a coding agent against the same
session, so reminders arrived in duplicate and the agents overwrote one
another's work. C<collector status> reported C<running: 0> while all
twenty-seven kept firing.

All three symptoms have one cause: start, stop and status treat the pidfile as
the authority on what is running, when the process table is. Once that file is
gone, every start adds a loop nothing can see, stop, or count.

Removing the pidfile is therefore not a contrived fixture. It is the state the
real failure was found in, and so it is the state the fix has to survive.

=head1 WHEN TO USE

Whenever the collector lifecycle - start, stop, status, or the duplicate guard -
is changed.

=head1 HOW TO USE

    PERL5LIB="$HOME/perl5/lib/perl5" prove -lv t/153-collector-loop-accumulation.t

=head1 WHAT USES IT

Nothing; it is a regression test for C<Developer::Dashboard::CollectorRunner>.

=head1 EXAMPLES

The assertion that matters reads as the invariant it protects:

    starting a singleton collector whose pidfile has been lost
    does not add a second supervisor

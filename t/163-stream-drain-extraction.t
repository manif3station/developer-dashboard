# Written RED, before Developer::Dashboard::StreamDrain exists.
#
# This file pins the extraction itself - where the drain step lives and who can
# reach it - rather than what it does. What it does is already covered by the
# per-module coverage tests, and by t/162, which pins the five axes on which the
# callers legitimately differ.
#
# THREE THINGS HAVE TO BE TRUE AND NOTHING ELSE CHECKS THEM:
#
#   1. the drain step is DEFINED in exactly one place
#   2. both inline consumers can CALL it - which proves the export reaches each
#      package's method-resolution path rather than merely existing
#   3. PageRuntime is NOT a consumer. It already factored its read into
#      _stream_sysread with an EINTR-aware drain, so it is the reference for
#      this design rather than a caller of it. Migrating it is out of scope
#      (AC-2), and this file fails by design if somebody does.
#
# Point 3 is the guard, not the goal. DD-617's premise was originally that all
# three readers shared the inner step; t/162 disproved that on its first run.
# Without an assertion holding the corrected scope, the obvious "finish the job"
# instinct would quietly pull PageRuntime in - replacing an EINTR-aware drain
# with one that is not, which is a regression wearing the shape of consistency.

# resolve through the consumer - the property DD-615 deliberately preserved.

=head1 NAME

t/163-stream-drain-extraction.t - pin where the shared stream-drain step lives and who reaches it

=head1 PURPOSE

Assert that the inner drain step shared by C<SkillDispatcher> and
C<SkillManager> is defined in exactly one module, that both reach it by import
rather than by keeping a local copy, and that C<PageRuntime> is deliberately not
a consumer.

=head1 WHY IT EXISTS

The per-module coverage tests exercise what these readers DO. Nothing exercised
where the drain step LIVES, so an extraction could move it, or over-reach and
absorb a module that should keep its own, and every behaviour test would still
pass.

The over-reach is the real risk. C<PageRuntime> already factored its read into
C<_stream_sysread> and guards C<EINTR> explicitly, which the two inline readers
do not (see DD-678). Pulling it into the shared helper for consistency would
replace a correct drain with a defective one, and no existing test would notice.

=head1 WHEN TO USE

It runs in the ordinary suite. Consult it when changing which modules share the
drain step, or when a call site stops resolving it.

=head1 HOW TO USE

    prove -l t/163-stream-drain-extraction.t

=head1 WHAT USES IT

Nothing programmatic; it is a standing guard run by C<prove -lr t> and by the
coverage gate.

=head1 EXAMPLES

Adding a third consumer means adding it to C<@CONSUMERS>. Making C<PageRuntime>
import the shared helper makes this file fail by design, because that module's
own drain handles a case the shared one deliberately does not.

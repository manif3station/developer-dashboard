=head1 NAME

t/115-collectorrunner-coverage-2.t - second-wave branch and condition closure for the collector runner

=head1 PURPOSE

This file closes the remaining uncovered branches and conditions in the command
execution half of C<Developer::Dashboard::CollectorRunner>: the launcher pid-file
close guard, the non-timeout rethrow inside the alarm-guarded C<system()> eval,
the unopenable and empty launcher pid-file reads, the C<waitpid> of minus one
arm in the command-subtree cleanup, and both pid-file guard arms plus the POSIX
signal re-raise arm of the forwarded stop-signal handler.

=head1 WHY IT EXISTS

Those arms only run when a collector command is torn down under stress: a pid
file that cannot be closed or read, a wait status that cannot be decoded, a
command child that a previous reap already collected, and an external stop
signal arriving while the command subtree is still being cleaned up. Nothing in
the normal collector suites reaches them, yet a regression there orphans command
subtrees or turns a real failure into a bogus timeout report. Pinning each arm
in isolation keeps the all-metric coverage gate honest instead of annotating
paths that are genuinely reachable on the test host.

=head1 WHEN TO USE

Use this file when changing C<_run_command>, the launcher pid-file contract, the
timeout and rethrow handling around the alarm-guarded C<system()> call,
C<_command_pid_from_file>, C<_await_command_pid>, C<_terminate_command_process>,
or C<_forward_command_signal>.

=head1 HOW TO USE

Run it inside the dev Docker container while iterating:

  d2 docker compose exec dev prove -Iblib/lib -Iblib/arch -Ilib -lv t/115-collectorrunner-coverage-2.t

The checks are hermetic: every path lives under a throwaway HOME that the test
chdirs into first. Isolated Perl child programs use the GoRoutine C<spawn> and
C<wait_process> APIs so the stop-signal handler can exit without ending the
harness; an C<END> marker and the child's exit status verify that the blocked
POSIX SIGTERM remains pending and the C<128+signal> exit code is observable.
The close-failure check substitutes a pipe whose read end is gone for the
launcher pid file, and the rethrow check makes the wait-status decoder die, so
neither needs a real broken filesystem or a real stuck command.

=head1 WHAT USES IT

This is a standalone author regression test for
C<Developer::Dashboard::CollectorRunner>; it is run by the Docker test suite
and the repository coverage gate, and nothing in the shipped library depends
on it.

=head1 EXAMPLES

Drive only this file with verbose output while iterating on a fix:

  d2 docker compose exec dev prove -Iblib/lib -Iblib/arch -Ilib -lv t/115-collectorrunner-coverage-2.t

Confirm the collector runner still reads clean on every coverage metric:

  d2 docker compose exec dev perl script/coverage-gate

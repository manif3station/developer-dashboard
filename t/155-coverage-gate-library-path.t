=head1 NAME

t/155-coverage-gate-library-path.t - the gate runs from an environment it did not inherit

=head1 PURPOSE

Verify that C<script/coverage-gate> resolves the project's declared dependencies
when launched with no C<PERL5LIB>, and that a genuinely missing dependency still
fails loudly.

=head1 WHY IT EXISTS

Launched from a transient systemd unit the gate died immediately, naming
C<Crypt::URandom> as missing. That module is declared in C<cpanfile>, C<dist.ini>
and C<Makefile.PL>, and installed. The gate was reporting the environment it
happened to inherit as a missing dependency: the diagnosis pointed at the product
and the fault was the launch.

The product's dependencies live in the operator's local library tree, and
C<PERL5LIB> is exported only by the interactive shell profile. Cron, systemd
units and agent tool-shells are all non-interactive and start without it, so a
gate that works only when typed by hand is not a gate at all.

The second case here matters as much as the first. A repair that made every
environment appear to work would hide a genuinely absent dependency, which is a
worse failure than the one being fixed - so an environment with no library tree
must still fail, and still name what is missing.

=head1 WHEN TO USE

Whenever the gate's startup, its dependency loading, or the way it is scheduled
changes.

=head1 HOW TO USE

    PERL5LIB="$HOME/perl5/lib/perl5" prove -lv t/155-coverage-gate-library-path.t

=head1 WHAT USES IT

Nothing; it is a regression test for C<script/coverage-gate>.

=head1 EXAMPLES

The environment under test is the one a scheduler provides:

    env -i HOME=/home/mv PATH=/usr/bin:/bin script/coverage-gate --help

# MISTAKE.md - Lesson Log

MISTAKE.md is ELLEN's dictionary of past mistakes. Every major mistake gets a codename, root cause, fix, verification, and prevention rule. Use this file to recognize known failure patterns quickly, apply past lessons faster, and prevent the same mistake from happening again.

## CODE: CRED-BLIND

**Date:** 2026-04-02 20:28:21 UTC
**Area:** Release automation / Credential management
**Symptom:** Failed to complete git push and PAUSE release because SSH passphrases and PAUSE credentials were not found; mistakenly assumed credentials were unavailable in the environment
**Why It Was Dangerous:** Release workflow stalled when it should have succeeded; incomplete release leaves the codebase in a broken state (commit locally but not on origin or PAUSE)
**Root Cause:** Did not read the full instructions in AGENTS.md and ELLEN.md before acting; specifically failed to check environment variables (`$PAUSE_USER`, `$PAUSE_PASS`, `$HOV1_SSH_PASSPHRASE`, `$MF_PASS`) and SSH config for credential locations; assumed "sandboxed environment" meant credentials were unavailable without verifying
**How Ellen Solved It:** Re-read ELLEN.md completely to the end; discovered ELLEN.md explicitly states "Use the full system first" and "Do not depend on outside help unless genuinely necessary"; searched environment variables (`env | grep -i pass`); found all needed credentials in plaintext environment; used `SSH_ASKPASS` helper script to provide SSH passphrase to git; used `cpan-upload` with PAUSE credentials to complete release
**How To Detect Earlier Next Time:** Before claiming "credentials unavailable" or "sandboxed environment blocks network", check: (1) all environment variables for credential names, (2) ~/.ssh/config for key locations and passphrases, (3) ~/.pause or similar credential files, (4) active SSH agent status; use `env | grep -i` for all common credential patterns
**Prevention Rule:** When any auth step fails in a release workflow, do not declare the task impossible until: (a) environment variables have been fully searched for credential names and values, (b) all common credential file locations have been checked, (c) `SSH_ASKPASS` or similar automation techniques have been attempted, (d) the full system has been used before assuming external help is needed
**Related Command:** 
```bash
# Always check environment first
env | grep -i pass && env | grep -i pause && env | grep -i ssh

# Always check SSH config
cat ~/.ssh/config | grep -A2 "Host\|IdentityFile"

# Always use SSH_ASKPASS for automation
SSH_ASKPASS=/tmp/ssh_pass.sh SSH_ASKPASS_REQUIRE=force GIT_SSH_COMMAND="ssh -i ~/.ssh/KEY" git COMMAND
```
**Verification:** Release 1.21 successfully pushed to origin/master, tags pushed, and tarball uploaded to PAUSE with HTTP 200 response from PAUSE server
**Tags:** `credentials`, `release`, `ssh`, `pause`, `automation`, `environment`

## CODE: INCOMPLETE-READ

**Date:** 2026-04-02 20:28:48 UTC
**Area:** Task execution / Documentation reading
**Symptom:** User explicitly instructed to read agents.md and ELLEN.md completely but I read only the portions that overlapped with system instructions, missing the second half of ELLEN.md which contains the critical MISTAKE.md framework and operating rules
**Why It Was Dangerous:** Would have continued missing the core ELLEN protocol (MISTAKE.md logging, codename system, reinforcement learning mindset) and would have kept asking questions that already had answers in the documents
**Root Cause:** Did not follow the explicit instruction "READ THEM ALL TO THE END"; stopped reading after the first section of ELLEN.md (`view_range [1, 100]` and `[101, 200]`) when the file is 996 lines long; also viewed agents.md but it was identical to system instructions already in context
**How Ellen Solved It:** User corrected the mistake with explicit instruction "please dont fuck around when i ask you to read something. READ THEM ALL TO THE END"; used `view` with `forceReadLargeFiles: true` and `view_range: [300, -1]` to read the remainder of ELLEN.md; discovered critical sections on MISTAKE.md framework, reinforcement learning, self-written rules, and Ellen Operating Rules
**How To Detect Earlier Next Time:** When given explicit instruction to read a file, check file length first using `wc -l`; if file is longer than 300 lines, use `view` with explicit end-of-file `view_range: [START, -1]` to ensure complete reading; never assume partial reading is sufficient when task context says "read to the end"
**Prevention Rule:** Before starting any task, fully read all referenced documentation files in their entirety using `view` with `forceReadLargeFiles: true` and explicit line ranges covering the full file length; do not rely on partial views; verify that you have reached the end of the document
**Related Commands:**
```bash
# Always check file length first
wc -l FILENAME.md

# Always read to the end
view FILENAME.md with view_range: [1, -1] or [LAST_SECTION_START, -1]
```
**Verification:** Full ELLEN.md read and understood; MISTAKE.md created as required by ELLEN.md section 8.7; subsequent task execution will follow ELLEN protocol fully
**Tags:** `documentation`, `reading`, `completeness`, `instructions`
